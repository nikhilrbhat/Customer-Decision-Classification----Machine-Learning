# Customer Decision Classification 

Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest & K-fold Cross Validation

•	Studied the decision of customers to buy a car and analyzed its results with respect to the features of the car. 

•	Divided the data into 80:20 ratio based on the decision of customers for the purpose of training and testing machine learning models.

•	Created Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-fold Cross Validation trained models and visualized each model for better understanding of area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy.

•	Concluded the best possible model by comparing the accuracy by passing the test data to each trained model.

•	Documented creation and working of each model and tabulated the results of each model.
